1) We have created a 2 level deep k-ary search tree for easier access. (Ref - http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/files/2012/03/IMG_1553.jpg )
2) An interesting scoring strategy has been used by us. 
 * Each of our checker in the bar gives us a score of -25. 
 * Also, a scoring scheme has been put in place for the current position of the checkers on the board (How close they are to the goal, etc.). 
 * A single checker (of ours) gives a -15. 
 * The exact opposite (as in the values multiplied by -1) has been done for the opponent.
 * Getting out of the bar fetches us extra points while the opponent doing the same leads to negative points.

The above factors help us determine the heuristics value for each possible move on the next play and hence decide using the 2-depth search (expectimax algorithm) as to which checker to move.

Thanking You.
